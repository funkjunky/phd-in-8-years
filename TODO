TODO
---

 *- strip react stuff and base code, package.json, rename tproject, etc.
 *- add dependencies for game dev
 - write some very basic code for scene graph
	*- global reducer "state.game" (month/day, money, happiness, self-deprecation, etc)
	*- each scene graph well have draw, reducer, controls, onload(opts), onunload
	*- scene.draw (give scene state, and global state as separate things)
	- create enough scenes to figure out the rest of below...
		*- sidewalk
		- bedroom
		- pause
		- transition -> [LeaveHome] toast > tooth brush > backpack > pan sun or clouds and fade in sidewalk scene
	- 

	- how to unload and load reducer?
		- state.scenes["lab"]
		- scene.load => add reducer, scene.unload => remove reducer
	- how to unload and load controls? (Need scene class)
		- scene.addEventListener -> scene.unload => scene.removeEventListener
	- pause screen is "pushed" onto another screen.
	- lab scene replaces sidewalk scene...
		- push transition scene
			- (lens flare, blizzard snow, zoom in and out of umbrella on Jane)
		- replace lab scene with sidewalk scene
		- pop transition scene

 - Put in Immer

 - get basic scene graph working (on click, toggle scenes)
 - Plan outline of game in this TODO

 - Do a basic implementation of the hill climbing scene
	- get a tileset from somewhere
	- use tileset to approximate the hill
	- Add Jane character
	- auto move the character up the hill
	- add controls to move left and right

 - I need to start the art! There well be a LOT
	- search for a montreal sprite sheet, or mcgill sprite sheet

Things to build:
 - effect-tick needs environments, like you may want to pause the game, but keep a pause screen animating frames, which could use effect-tick
	~ maybe environment ids "game" "pause"

 - play with the oscillator, try to make sound effects and music!
