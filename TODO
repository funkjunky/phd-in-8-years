 *- strip react stuff and base code, package.json, rename tproject, etc.
 *- add dependencies for game dev
 - write some very basic code for scene graph

 - get basic scene graph working (on click, toggle scenes)
 - Plan outline of game in this TODO

 - Do a basic implementation of the hill climbing scene
	- get a tileset from somewhere
	- use tileset to approximate the hill
	- Add Jane character
	- auto move the character up the hill
	- add controls to move left and right

 - I need to start the art! There well be a LOT
	- search for a montreal sprite sheet, or mcgill sprite sheet

Things to build:
 - effect-tick needs environments, like you may want to pause the game, but keep a pause screen animating frames, which could use effect-tick
	~ maybe environment ids "game" "pause"
